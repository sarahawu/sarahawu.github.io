I am a second-year PhD student in Psychology at Stanford University, advised by [Tobi Gerstenberg](http://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/){:target="_blank"} in the [Causality in Cognition Lab](http://cicl.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} and supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
I received double BS degrees (virtually!) from MIT studying math, computer science, and cognitive science.
At MIT, I worked with [Josh Tenenbaum](http://cocosci.mit.edu/josh){:target="_blank"} and [Max Kleiman-Weiner](http://www.mit.edu/~maxkw/){:target="_blank"} in the CoCoSci group and with [Ted Gibson](http://tedlab.mit.edu/ted.html){:target="_blank"} in the TedLab.

My research focuses on computational modeling of social cognition.
I study how people use counterfactual reasoning to make social inferences and judgments about each other, and try to formalize these processes using tools such as Bayesian inference and reinforcement learning.
Outside of research, I like boba, running, music, and design.
I also mentor local high school students through the [Stanford FAST](https://fast.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} program and discuss tech ethics with [Stanford C&S](https://stanford-cscs.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
