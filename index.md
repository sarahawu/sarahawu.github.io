I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Psychology at Stanford University
advised by [Tobi Gerstenberg](http://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/){:target="_blank"}.
My research focuses on causal and counterfactual reasoning in social contexts.
I integrate behavioral experiments and computational modeling
to study how people infer, understand, explain, and judge each other's actions.

I am supported by a [Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sigf){:target="_blank"},
the [Cooperative AI Foundation](https://www.cooperativeai.com/foundation),
and the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"}.
I have had research internships at AI2 and Apple.
Before graduate school, I studied math, computer science, and cognitive science at MIT, where I worked with
[Josh Tenenbaum](http://cocosci.mit.edu/josh){:target="_blank"}
and [Ted Gibson](http://tedlab.mit.edu/ted.html){:target="_blank"}.

Outside of research, I like reading, listening to music, drinking boba, and spending time with my dog.
I am committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in science, and
formerly led a high school science outreach program called [Stanford FAST](https://fast.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
