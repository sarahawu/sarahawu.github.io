I am a third-year PhD student in Psychology at Stanford University,
advised by [Tobi Gerstenberg](http://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/){:target="_blank"}
and supported by a [Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sigf){:target="_blank"}
and the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"}.
I received double BS degrees from MIT studying math, computer science, and cognitive science.
At MIT, I worked with [Josh Tenenbaum](http://cocosci.mit.edu/josh){:target="_blank"} in the CoCoSci group and with [Ted Gibson](http://tedlab.mit.edu/ted.html){:target="_blank"} in the TedLab.
I am currently a research intern at AI2 on the [Mosaic](https://mosaic.allenai.org/) team working with [Sydney Levine](https://sites.google.com/site/sydneymlevine/) and [Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io/).

My research focuses on causal and counterfactual reasoning in social contexts.
I integrate behavioral experiments and computational modeling
to study how people infer, understand, explain, and judge each other's actions.
Outside of research, I like music, design, running, and boba.
I lead a high school science outreach program called [Stanford FAST](https://fast.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}
and discuss tech ethics with [Stanford Computing & Society](https://stanford-cscs.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
